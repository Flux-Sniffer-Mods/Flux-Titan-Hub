"""Versions and release notes for Flux Keyboard builds.

  flux_release.py version <branch> [version_name]
      Prints kind=, name= and code= lines for $GITHUB_OUTPUT. The flux-release branch builds
      full releases: the newest version in whats_new.json's "releases". Every other branch
      builds dev builds: the next version after that, stamped with the build time
      (0.93-flux.yyyyMMddHHmm). A given version_name must be of the branch's kind.

  flux_release.py notes <version> <previous tag or ""> <commit>
      Prints release notes listing only what changed since the previous build: for a full
      release the previous full release, for a dev build the previous build of either kind.

  flux_release.py stamp
      Gives every entry in whats_new.json its "after": the time (UTC) of the commit that added
      its text, so new entries need no time written by hand and none can be later than the
      build that brings it. Run in the build before Gradle and the notes; the file is checked
      too (broken JSON or an entry without text stops the build).

Entries in whats_new.json are either text or {"text", "after": "yyyyMMddHHmm"}: new since the
build made at "after". Full releases carry no time in their name, so "releases" maps each one
to the time it was built.
